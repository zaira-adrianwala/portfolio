Hello, I'm Zaira Adrianwala!
I’m a Master of Engineering student in Bioengineering Design at UC Berkeley, building on my B.S. from UC San Diego, and I’m driven to create technologies that improve patient outcomes. My work focuses on bridging engineering and medicine through thoughtful, hands-on design, and I’m especially interested in medical devices, prosthetics, and surgical robotics. I’m also committed to mentorship, community engagement, and expanding access to bioengineering as I continue growing as an engineer.
